    * dump results of benchmarks that failed to file (+ machine where it run,
      so that we can easily find the log)
    * add --exclude options: exclude some sets of benchmarks
    (i. e. symbiotic timeouts on all ECA benchmarks, so until we solve it,
     we don't want to run ECA benchmarks)

SYMBIOTIC
    * temporary directory created by run_on_benchmark is not deleted
      (fix - create it in run_benchmark)

DATABASE
    * what is year_id in tools table good for?
    * save structure of database to .sql file and add to repo
    * read database settings and login info from configs file
    * set CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as default to the rest of tables
    * there are still some unknown tasks
