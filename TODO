    * dump results of benchmarks that failed to file (+ machine where it run,
      so that we can easily find the log)

SYMBIOTIC
    * temporary directory created by run_on_benchmark is not deleted
      (fix - create it in run_benchmark)
    * memory consumption not is measured correctly
    * currently there are many errors in building on bens
    * instead of assert() instrument __assert_fail()

DATABASE
    * read database settings and login info from configs file
    * set CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as default to years
